# RUM_TidyTuesday_2020 - Repo for March 18th

Today we're going to focus on wrangling and visualising the Tidy Tuesday dataset on UFO sightings.  The dataset and information about it can be found here:

https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-25

You can download the data into your R session and map it onto a variable called `ufo_sightings` with:

`library(tidyverse)`\
`ufo_sightings <- read_csv("https://bit.ly/3bQTJAV")`  

Your challenges is to recreate one (or more!) of the visualisations below.
