# RUM_TidyTuesday_2020 - Repo for Wednesday March 18th

Due to the dynamic coronavirus situation, this meeting will be held virtually.  I have set up a conference call on jitsi that you can acess at 1200 on the day.  This well work best using Chrome - so I recommend you use that to launch the meeting:

We're going to focus on wrangling and visualising the `Tidy Tuesday` dataset on UFO sightings.  The dataset and information about it can be found here:

https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-06-25

You can download the data into your R session and map it onto a variable called `ufo_sightings` with:

`library(tidyverse)`\
`ufo_sightings <- read_csv("https://bit.ly/3bQTJAV")`  

Your challenge is to either recreate one (or more!) of the visualisations below - or to create your own!

Towards the end of the session each of you can share you screens (if you want) to show your visualisations.  I'll then update the this repo with the code that I used to generate my visualisations.
